Official Bio
"Sweet bites! It's Yozora Mel, the Underworld's vampire prodigy!"

A vampire prodigy from the Underworld. She might be a vampire, but she is not into blood. She likes her acerola juice quite a lot.

Overview
Yozora Mel is a vampire who is a member of Hololive 1st Generation. Her debut was on May 13th, 2018.[11]

Despite being a vampire, she does not like blood and will instead drink Acerola juice.

Her representative emote is a star due to her last name "Yozora", which translates to "night sky"

Personality
Yozora Mel is an individual with a calming, caring and sweet personality. Her calm voice and demeanor make her quite relaxing to watch and she rarely tends to shout or scream excessively even in the face of unexpected events. She does however have the tendency to act lewd, especially in collaboration streams with close friend Yuzuki Choco, which belies her innocent and sweet demeanor. [12][13] Her ASMR streams were a fan favorite and of course added to her provocative perception. However she privated all her earlier ASMR content much like many of the other hololive members after her channel was demonetized, although the cause was due to a song she had posted prior to doing so being copyright flagged by YouTube.

Mel enjoys holding talking streams which allows her to interact more with her fans and is fond of her Kapu-min for the support and encouragement they had shown her during her hiatus. After the harassment she had faced, Mel came out with a public statement on May16th in the hopes that no other hololive member would have to go through what she experienced thus further highlighting her caring nature.[14] [15]
