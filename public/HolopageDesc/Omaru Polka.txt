Official Bio
A circus performer who joined hololive in hopes of becoming the ringmaster of the VTuber world.

She enjoys wowing audiences with acrobatics, and she lives by the words, 'When you've decided you're gonna do something, follow through!'

Her natural charm glosses over her occasional mess-ups.

Personality
Polka is highly energetic, and often speaks faster than even native Japanese viewers are capable of understanding. Her emotions fluctuate wildly: one moment she is extremely loud and energetic, and the next she is quiet and subdued.

Polka's streams are chaotic: she talks fast and loose, jumping quickly to and from a variety of topics. Even if she has a list of talking points, she quickly veers into related tangents, only returning to the original topic after a long time. Her unpredictability extends to how she plays games; this is more noticeable in open world games, like Minecraft and ARK, where she plays with a plan in mind which eventually gets abandoned in favor of doing something else entirely that catches her attention on the spot. Her in-game projects are often stalled by these distractions despite her intention to work hard on them, though when she does complete one it is after numerous adventurous detours.

By her own account, Polka is easily affected by the weather, in particular atmospheric pressure. If she decides to stream on a day with low pressure, she almost always starts with less energy than usual; eventually she perks back up as she has fun doing whatever activity she is streaming. On more than one occasion she has streamed 2+ hours of karaoke early in the morning simply because she had a headache and thought to get rid of it by singing.

Like Marine, Polka is knowledgeable about 90s and 2000s anime and otaku culture, and is touchy about her age.
