Official Bio
Fuwawa Abyssgard
The fluffy older twin sister of The Demonic Guard Dogs, who were sealed away in The Cell for being a pain in the godly behind, Fuwawa Abyssgard is "The Fluffy One."

Her duty is to calmly look after her younger twin sister Mococo and their pet Pero, but that calmness can be short-lived. Ultimately, she is a bouncy and boisterous girl who loves to chat and play.

Mococo Abyssgard
The fuzzy younger twin sister of The Demonic Guard Dogs, who were sealed away in The Cell for being a pain in the godly behind, Mococo Abyssgard is "The Fuzzy One." The rambunctious Mococo spent all her time imprisoned watching anime and playing games, often roping her older twin sister Fuwawa and their pet Pero in for more chaotic antics. It's rumored that she took part in the prison break just for the heck of it.

Overview
FUWAMOCO is the duo name adopted by sisters Fuwawa (フワワ) and Mococo (モココ) Abyssgard (アビスガード), who are VTubers that debuted as the “Demonic Guard Dogs” of hololive English -Advent-. As identical twins[1] born on the 1st and 2nd February respectively, they live by the mottos of “have fun”, “make mistakes”, and “[have] no regrets”.[2]

FUWAMOCO are characterised by their playful and energetic personalities, sibling synchronicity, cutesy giggles and interactions, and unwavering loyalty to their Ruffian fans; with them even making a “Pledge of Loyalty” to Ruffians during their debut stream[3] – this fan name also demonstrating the pair’s affection for dog-related wordplay and puns.

Interaction with Ruffians plays an important part of their streams, with a regular staple of their content being their tri-weekly “FUWAMOCO Morning” talk show. Cycling through a variety of talk themes including “Doggie of the Day” and “Today I Went for a Walk” (as well as ones relating to recent milestones and hololive-related events), they offer their thoughts on Tweets submitted relating to Ruffians’ own, everyday lives.[4] This care for their fans is reinforced by their answer when asked for the best way to make them happy: which involved simply being there with them during streams, generally being passionate about being a Ruffian, and getting along with other people; Ruffians and non-Ruffians alike.[5]


Personality
As the older sister, Fuwawa often takes the lead in conversation with her calmer and more collected demeanour; though she is perhaps unexpectedly the clumsier of the two.[6] On the other hand, Mococo’s spontaneity, excitability and mischievousness make her a complementary foil to her twin, with this mischievous side seen when she light-heartedly teases her sister.[7]

FUWAMOCO are a tightly knit pair, with them very rarely getting into serious arguments (or if they do, they tend to quickly make up)[8] and always falling back on one another whenever either of them is feeling down. This closeness manifests in the emotions felt by one of the twins often ‘transferring’ to the other, and their sharing of the same dreams and nightmares on some nights. However, this closeness can also make them feel alone or isolated as a pair if other people struggle to know how to ‘fit in’ between the two.[9]

Fuwawa and Mococo both care deeply for their fans, saying that their job is to “protect [Ruffians’] smiles”,[10] – a sentiment echoed by their aim with “FUWAMOCO Morning” streams: to “bring a smile to your face, and help you start your day off on the right pawth.”[11]
