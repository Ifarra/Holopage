Official Bio
After taking over her great blacksmithing teacher's forge, she felt a lack of excitement in her life.

So, she decided to be free and depart on a journey to find rare smithing materials, one of which was rumored to be under the building of a certain idol group in town.

She also loves challenging herself and has a peculiar taste when it comes to foods!

Personality
This penguin blacksmith is really a hard-working thing. she is really caring and likes to help others but the most favorite thing from her is her randomness.
