Official Bio
A girl who came from another world in order to become an idol.
She loves singing and dancing, and drawing.
She is training hard every day to become someone loved by many.

Overview
Meet the “Love Warrior” Nenechi, a girl who possesses a quiet fire in her heart! She hails from Planet Tao Tao, and has come to earth to pursue her idol dream! Let’s support her immensely!

Her character backstory shares a lot of similarities with the character Kagura from Gintama, including the “aru” verbal tic. Her design borrows heavily from chinese-style dresses, and her character emote 🥟 :dumpling: is taken from her favorite food, gyoza.

Some months after her debut, she stopped adding “aru” at the end of her sentences. When fans asked why she doesn’t use “aru” anymore, she mentions that she’s been pronouncing them so fast it’s become inaudible to her viewer's ears.

Personality
Nene has a bubbly, friendly personality, and is very close with her fellow Gen 5 members. She often displays a cute smugness when she wins games, and pouts cutely whenever she loses. She playfully flirts with the other hololive members, with some examples including Lamy and Ina.

True to her idol dream, Nene has displayed her great singing ability during her karaoke streams and mini lives. She has mentioned that she knows how to dance (2-3 years experience), so fans can look forward to seeing her dance during her eventual 3d debut.

She likes playing casual games like LITTLE FRIENDS, PART TIME UFO, Good Job!, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and Minecraft. She also does singing practice streams, and sometimes does ASMR for her members-only streams.

Oftentimes, she streams during lunchtime to chat with her fans, and has a Super Chat thanking segment afterwards. Some fans ask Nene through Super Chat, "Will you be my waifu?", with Nene responding to them, "Yes! Welcome to Nene's husbands collection!" Female fans have also expressed interest, with Nene responding that wives are also welcome as part of her collection.

She sometimes says a few basic lines in English and Spanish when interacting with her audience, leading to an increased number of foreign fans on her livestreams; fans have dubbed her the nickname “Worldwide Nenechi” whenever this occurs. Nene also seems to get new nicknames every time she streams; with some examples including supernenechi, hypernenechi, ultranenechi, NENEMAX, and most importantly, Super Hyper Ultra Ultimate Deluxe Perfect Amazing Shining God 東方不敗 Master Ginga Victory Strong Cute Beautiful Galaxy Baby 無限 無敵 無双 NENECHI (!)
