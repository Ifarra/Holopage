Overview
Oozora Subaru is a MMA and e-sports club manager who debuted as part of Hololive 2nd Generation.

Although tomboyish in nature, her feminine side often shows itself during interactions with her friends.

She is often teased as a comedian because of how naturally takes the tsukkomi role while interacting with others.

She is also known for making a raspy whispering voice when doing ASMR[13][14], leading into her being teased as Donald Duck. The joke was taken further on a 3D Livestream with Roboco where she made a 3D appearance as a duck wearing her signature baseball cap.[15]

Her representative emote is an ambulance because one of her first tweets was an ambulance meme about her followers increasing. [16]
