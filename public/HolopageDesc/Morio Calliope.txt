Official Bio
The Grim Reaper's first apprentice. Due to modern medical care causing a decline in the reaping business, Calliope decided to become a VTuber to harvest souls instead. It seems that the ascended souls of the people who are vaporized by the wholesome interactions between VTubers go to her as well.
That being said, despite the image her hardcore vocals and manner of speech gives off, she's actually a gentle-hearted girl who cares greatly for her friends.

Overview
Calliope Mori, officially listed as Mori Calliope (森カリオペ), is a reaper Virtual YouTuber who debuted as a member of the Hololive English -Myth-. Her fans and gen-mates often refer to her as Calli for short. Despite being a sweet-voiced girl with a gentle personality, Calli tends to talk about morbid topics with little hesitation. Her favorite color is red, she enjoys sweets and reaping souls, and she likes watching mafia movies and drinking red wine. Her given name, "Calliope," can be mistakenly read as "cantaloupe," a fruit she vehemently despises. (The correct pronunciation is "kuh-LAHY-uh-pee".)

Despite living in the Underworld, Calli loves anime such as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Made in Abyss, and videogames such as Bloodborne and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Mori is a talented musician, her debut original song, "Excuse My Rudeness, But Could You Please RIP?", broke 100k views within the first day it was uploaded.

Personality
The Grim Reaper's apprentice has displayed throughout her streams, guest appearances, and music to have a cool, yet serious personality, with a timid side being seen when interacting with others for the first time, such as her senpais.[18] [19] Calli's cool attitude can be clearly observed in most of her streams, as she tries her best to impress the deadbeats with her musical talent and occasional gaming skills. However, she is not afraid to get serious about topics that may be on her mind, and engages in thoughtful discussions with viewers.[20] This combination of a relaxed yet serious personality has earned her the admiration of not only the Deadbeats, but her fellow Holopro talents as well. However, Calli's playful side comes out more evidently during collaborations with her genmates, displaying a side of Calli which viewers don't regularly experience.[21] [22] [23] Calli still remains above all an avid hard worker who is regularly working on projects behind the scenes, often not sleeping for long periods of time. [24] Despite the challenges that she may face while working on these projects, each one is very much rewarded and appreciated by her Deadbeats each time a new original song or cover is released.[25]
