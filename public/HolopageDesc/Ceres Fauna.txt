Official Bio
Keeper of "Nature"

A member of the Council and the Keeper of "Nature", the second concept created by the gods.

She has materialized in the mortal realm as a druid in a bid to save nature.

She has Kirin blood flowing in her veins, and horns that are made out of the branches of a certain tree; they are NOT deer antlers.

"Nature" refers to all organic matter on the planet except mankind.

It is long said that her whispers, as an avatar of Mother Nature, have healing properties. Whether or not that is true is something only those who have heard them can say.

While she is usually affable, warm, and slightly mischievous, any who anger her will bear the full brunt of Nature's fury.

Overview
Fauna is a soft-spoken girl with a comforting, motherly aura, though she has described herself as being more of an older sister. She has an innate talent to draw the attention of those around her despite her soft-spoken voice. Her comforting aura and soft-spoken voice are a great combination during her ASMR streams,which often include a variety of segments from ear cleaning to sometimes lengthy off-topic discussions.[13] As the embodiment of nature, Fauna has been able to easily charm and plant herself into the hearts of her saplings and fellow council members with both her physical beauty and personality.
