Official Bio
She is the mysterious 7th recruit of The Secret Archive Unit that has a full license to collect virtual data.

Despite her being a promising rookie, who is also known as codename V.7, she turns clumsy when things are not going exactly according to the manual.

It was initially a lonely mission to infiltrate the virtual world, but now she had found comfort here. Will this mission end up leading her to a new destiny instead...?

Overview
Vestia Zeta, Codename: V.7. An agent from the Secret Archive Unit and a member of Hololive Indonesia 3rd Generation. Debuted on March 25, 2022, able to speak in: Indonesian, English, Japanese and Korean. With the latter two being "baby level" according to Zeta in her debut stream. She is currently enjoying her time play, discover and learn new games like Vampire Survivors, Mario Kart, etc. Whilst showing a side of her clumsiness, hence the common use of "Pon" by the Zecretaries whenever such moments occurs.

Personality
Zeta adopts quite an adorable and curious personality similar to her favorite animal, cats. At the same time she is quite fearless as shown in her Outlast 2 [3] and in late parts of DEVOUR collab w/ Kaela & Kobo[4]. Even refusing to get backseated unless she is really lost, disliking hime-plays and stream snipes like in APEX streams.

However despite her strong side, she also revealed a hint of her soft spot [5][6] which she stated that she is the kind who easily cries on an especially sad scenes. Of course, we shouldn't forget about her various "Pon" (clumsiness) moments in most of her streams.
