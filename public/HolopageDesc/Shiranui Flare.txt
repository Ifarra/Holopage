Overview
Shiranui Flare (不知火フレア) is the half-elf of Hololive's 3rd generation. She debuted on August 7th, 2019, and later debuted on bilibili on October 25th, 2019. Flare is considered as a big sister figure within her generation, and is also well-liked with other Hololive members due to her calm, yet kind demeanor. She received her first alternate outfit during the 2019 New Year's relay, which she used for all of her streams. This outfit also received a L2D update on July 15th, 2020. Her fourth outfit, a casual sailor-style dress, was unveiled on November 14th, 2020.

Flare's 3D debut which was originally announced for a reveal on March 29th, 2020[12][13] was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic (due to the government's discouragement of public gathering). A "re-announcement" was made on June 10th, 2020[14] to reveal her 3D and finally, Flare's 3D model debuted on the date June 13, 2020[15]. This model had significant updates compared to the model that was used during Nonstop Story.

Flare refers to her friends as Elfriend (エルフレンド), a portmanteau of the word "Elf" and "Friend".

Flare's streaming content can be categorized into three main groups: gaming, singing, and chatting streams. Generally, her streams tend to be on the longer side, and start late at night, often streaming for at least 3 to 4 hours. She likes action games such as Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Devil May Cry, but has more recently enjoyed interacting with others, exploring, and building in Minecraft and ARK. In her singing streams, she's known for her wide vocal range, and holds karaoke streams regularly. Her chat streams are more laid back, and often accompanied with drinks while she talks about recent events or whatever's on her mind at the time. Other streams include movie-watchalongs and frequent offline collaborations with other members. Rarely, Flare will also draw alongside other members, and shows significant skill with her artwork.

Flare is part of the Onee-san Gumi (お姉さん組) along with Shirogane Noel and Houshou Marine, and together with Shirakami Fubuki and Tsunomaki Watame make up the trio named Bakatare.

Personality
Flare can be called the definite big sister of her generation (or sometime, even the whole Hololive!) due to her cool and mature personality. Flare acts in a very calm and collected manner, rarely losing herself to frustration or rage on stream, most visible with her playthroughs of difficult games such as Getting Over It or Dark Souls.

Flare is also very understanding and dependable, and it is not rare that others look up to her. One instance is when she played Getting Over it to accompany Noel in her endurance stream. After being informed that Noel lost a lot of progress, she called Noel to comfort her as well as joke a bit to cheer her up.[16] After Noel finished the game, she closed her game shortly after to congratulate Noel. Another is her frequent gifts and willingness to help others in the Minecraft and ARK servers, often leaving souvenirs or valuables that she's obtained through her adventures.

However, she is also a very playful person and can act quite cutely at times. This is most evident in her solo streams, where she will very often just suddenly launch into gags and/or skits out of nowhere. Her karaoke setlist is extremely varied, from cool songs with her deep voice range, to funny and silly denpa style songs.

Additionally, Flare also uses a very formal and polite manner on occasion, often visible when interacting with new people. She also does a little bow whenever reading and/or thanking Superchat, and will read every message from every Superchat when time permits.

Flare has collaborated with many different VTubers from both within and outside of Hololive. She's extremely close with her generation, but also isn't afraid of collaborating with other members, such as Fubuki, Watame, Luna, Aqua, and Miko to name a few. Outside of Hololive, she's extremely good friends with Suou Patra of Honeystrap, has appeared on multiple interviews with Inuyama Tamaki, and also hung out with Nijisanji's Debidebi Debiru.
