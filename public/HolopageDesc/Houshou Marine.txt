Official Bio
"Ahoy! Captain of the Houshou Pirates, Houshou Marine here!" "Keep 'er steady!"

Loves jewels, treasure, and money. Her dream is to become a pirate and go treasure hunting. In order to get a pirate ship, she is now stacking up money as a VTuber on the great lands, just like how the other land-lovers do (which also means she is currently just a girl cosplayer).
She acts like a big sis and sometimes seduces people like a succubus does. A sensual, femme fatale boss, and a young one, at that! (Around 17)
Her pirate outfit is just cosplay, and quite lewd when you see it that way.

Overview
Houshou Marine (宝鐘マリン) born July 30th, is a pirate cosplayer and a Vtuber for the Hololive 3rd Generation. Marine is a beautiful and elegant young lady who is definitely 17 years old despite her knowledge of early 2000 anime and internet memes. She is often referred to as "Senchou" (船長 - Ship Captain) by her viewers and peers. She loves jewels, treasure, and money. Her dream is to become a pirate and go treasure hunting. In order to get a pirate ship, she is now stacking up money as a VTuber on the great lands, just like how the other land-lovers do. She acts like a big sister (despite definitely only being 17) and sometimes often seduces other VTubers who she then draws in questionable situations.

Marine is a competent artist who can easily produce artwork at the quality of a mangaka. She has mentioned previously that she would like to have pursued being a mangaka but does not believe she would be comfortable with keeping up with the tight deadlines and stress of it.

Often joked she is not an actual pirate or captain as she lacks a ship and crew, and is instead cosplaying as a Pirate Captain.

Her representative emote is a flag & skull (known as Jolly Roger) because of her pirate theming.
