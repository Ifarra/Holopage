Official Bio
Despite her looks, Ina'nis is actually a priestess of the Ancient Ones. One day, she picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her. However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.
After gaining power, she started hearing Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to deliver random sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.

Overview
Ninomae Ina’nis is a human girl of undisclosed age, joining as part of Hololive EN’s holoMyth group. Contrary to her lovecraftian horror-esque appearance, she has gained a reputation to be the most tranquil of HoloEN bunch. An extremely talented artist, Ina's sketching and drawing streams have earned the praise and admiration of not only the Takodachis, but her fellow Holopro members as well.[15] Ina is also a Pun enthusiast, regularly making puns any time she gets the opportunity, regardless of the timing or situation. Of course, this has some unforeseen consequences such as her jokes falling flat, resulting in viewers typing out "INAFF" in the live chat.[16] As the priestess of the Ancient Ones, she is not afraid to release her hidden power to enforce chat rules, with the assistance of AO-Chan. Unfortunately, Takodachis have adapted and come to embrace Ina's bonking, which has been done with crowbars as well.[17] When combined with the rest of Holomyth, she attempts to play the Straight Man role, however she eventually gives in to her genmates' often chaotic schemes.

Personality
Ina’nis, nicknamed Ina by her own request, is a soft-spoken yet sociable individual with an easy-going temperament. She is very loving and aware towards her fellow members, capable of talking extensively about each one and their respective quirks. Ina is very engaged in popular culture with massively diverse tastes, enjoying a large variety of genres in an equally large pool of mediums, whether it be mecha anime, pop rock, fps, only to name a few. A notable feature of Ina is her significant artistic talent, illustrating multiple promotional content for HoloEN as well as the majority of assets she uses for her vtuber activities.
