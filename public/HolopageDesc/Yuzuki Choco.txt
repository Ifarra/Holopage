Official Bio
"Good evening, my cute students! Choc-on!"

The school nurse at the Underworld Academy. Is incredibly popular among the students, with the boys in particular coming to get checked up all the time. Loves sweets, and often gets into trouble for leaving them strewn about on her desk.

Overview
Yuzuki Choco (癒月ちょこ) is the local school nurse demon of Hololive 2nd Generation hailing from the Demonic-Realm Academy. Despite people often mistaking her as a succubus (perhaps to her overwhelming charm and expert-level skill of teasing), she has clearly stated that she is not one. Being the nurse of the Demonic-Realm Academy, (almost) everyone refer to Choco as Choco-sensei (ちょこ先生), both fans and fellow VTubers alike, even including those outside Hololive. Choco-sensei debuted on YouTube at September 4, 2018 with her Twitter account being created much earlier at August 2, 2018. Among fellow members of 2nd Gen it is fair to say that Choco-sensei has the definite adult-charm to her, not only in her design, but also in her demeanor. She had her 3D Debut on the date May 25, 2019 and her 2nd L2D outfit at July 25, 2019. Along with everyone else, Choco-sensei also got a New Years outfit at December 31, 2019. Her third outfit (which have a maid motif) was revealed on October 25, 2020. The new outfit also comes with update 2.1 for her L2D (which was already updated to 2.0 before at July 29, 2020)

Choco-sensei's fanbase is called Choco Mate (ちょこめいと). Also Choco usually refers to other streamers with the honorifics -sama(様).

Choco-sensei's primary content ranges from ASMR, regular collaboration programs (such as her physical exam), Gaming and Cooking. ASMR used to be one of Choco-sensei's primary contents, yet due to YouTube's increasingly unfriendly behavior towards ASMR-related content, her ASMR streams have been mostly archived for member-limited, but the stream itself free for all. Aside from ASMR, Choco-sensei does a good amount of gaming streams, especially for certain games, primarily APEX, ARK and Dead by Daylight. While she does occasionally try out and play other games, ARK and Dead by Daylight are the two most common games that she plays, along with some APEX. Additionally Choco-sensei also semi-regularly does cooking stream, usually around at daytime, though occasionally there are times she cooks late at night. These cooking streams do not use live-camera, and instead are essentially similar to a chat stream, with Choco-sensei cooking in the background. She always details the recipe she is using and also snaps a picture of the result which she both shows on stream and posts on Twitter. In regards to singing, Choco is similar to Shirogane Noel in that they both know and acknowledge their shortcomings in that particular department. Choco-sensei even often refer to her singing as Song of Ruin (滅びの歌). That being said however Choco still tries to improve and does her best, both on-stream and off-stream.

Solo stream aside, Choco-sensei also has a series of collab streams called "Choco-sensei's Physical Exam". This stream consist of Choco-sensei and another guest (which can be either a member of Hololive Productions or even outside of Hololive), and they go together through a number of different test that Choco has prepared beforehand. Aside from this series, Choco-sensei also does a lot of regular collaboration streams both with members of Hololive Productions and outside.

Together with Yozora Mel, the two of them make the pair Melty Kiss.
