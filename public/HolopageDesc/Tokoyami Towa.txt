Official Bio
"Sup, groupies!"

A young devil who is visiting human society to gain experience and develop her skills. But instead of studying, she became addicted to video games! After learning about a tool for communicating with humans called "streaming," she's trying it out to help with her studies.

Overview
Tokoyami Towa (常闇トワ) is a member of Hololive 4th Generation and a "small devil" (小悪魔) from the devil world.

She often talks like a gyaru and addresses herself as Towa-sama (トワ様).

The hat she has on is actually her pet Bibi (ビビ), a guardian and protector given to her by her mother in order to look after her during her studies. When asked if there would be Bibi hat merchandise, she answered that there is only one Bibi and that he is not for sale.

She is an avid FPS player, with the current FPS games that she usually plays on-stream being Valorant and APEX.

Despite being a devil, she is often referred to as an angel due to her behavior, much to her dismay.

Some instances of her angel-like behavior include:

Having a healthy sleep schedule and the tendency to do early morning streams. Kiryu Coco has also questioned if Towa is actually an angel because of this on an Asacoco episode.[12]
Being known to cook healthy meals.[13]
Surprising her fellow 4th Generation Hololive members with cakes during the Hololive 4th Generation takoyaki party hosted at her place.[14] She also washed the dishes afterwards on her own.[15]
Her representative emote is a Space Invader.
