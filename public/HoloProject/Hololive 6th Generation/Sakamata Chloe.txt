Official Bio
An intern who acts as a fixer and cleaner for Secret Society holoX.

Calm and composed at all times, she carries out her orders without so much as batting an eyelid.

She loves music and can be found listening to it every chance she gets.

And while she denies it vehemently, she apparently tends to come across as guarded and not very upfront with her thoughts, only letting people get very occasional glimpses into how she really feels.
