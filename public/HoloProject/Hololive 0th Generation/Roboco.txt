Overview
Roboco is a Virtual Robot in the Hololive 0th Generation of VTubers. Her character is that of a high-performance robot that is good with shooters. Along with other 0th generation members Sora and Miko, she does not have a 2D model and streams using her 3D model instead. She is usually called Roboco-san but since she was the 2nd member to join Hololive after Sora, she is sometimes called Roboco Senpai. She started as a 3D project (not intended to be a VTuber) by her designer kuromaru.

Her representative emote is a robot because she is a robot.

Personality
She has a calm but air-headed personality and is fond of cute things. Roboco-san gets along with a lot of her peers within Hololive, as well as with other VTubers from different agencies. She is easily embarrassed, does not like horror games, and hates being spooked.

Even though she doesn't like horror games, she likes watching horror, suspense, and gore movies. She likes the "excited" feeling from watching the gore scenes in horror movies, but she can't handle being the character in the horror games. Because she watched too many horror movies, she saw a lot of horror dream as well.
