Overview
Takanashi Kiara (小鳥遊キアラ) born July 6th is a phoenix warrior Virtual YouTuber who debuted as a member of Hololive English -Myth-.

She enjoys fast food, hats and adventuring. Kiara is an avid fan of chicken as seen in her stream opening animation illustrated by fellow Hololive English member Mori Calliope, however dislikes it when people mistake her for one. She also dislikes scary things and unrequited love. When not streaming, she enjoys eating, singing, drawing and fighting.

Personality
Takanashi Kiara has an energetic, passionate, and extroverted personality. She has seemingly no trouble holding a conversation with other talents, both within and outside of hololive [20]. Kiara has no problem taking the lead in collaborations, and performing as host whenever the situation calls for it. Her energetic personality is also prevalent in her original songs, most notably SPARKS and HINOTORI, as they both have fast-paced beats and lyrics that feature an encouraging and positive message. Kiara is very fond of her genmates, and regularly mentions and commends them for their hard work, both on-stream and on social media. While her relationship with Mori Calliope may be described as flirtatious in nature, their interactions continue to reinforce the trust and comradely spirit between the two. Her fanbase is no different, as the KFP have regularly been subjects of her gratitude for their support, while also playfully experiencing her frustration by getting sent to "The Usual Room".
