Official Bio
"Welcome to your rouge awakening! This is Akai Haato!"

A sassy kouhai. She is often prickly, but she'll try to get a lot of attention from those who have made friends with her. She loves red ribbons and heart shapes, and she'll wear them often in her hair and on her clothes.

Overview
Akai Haato is a member of Hololive 1st Generation.

Her name "Akai" translates to "red" and "Haato" is how Japanese pronounces the word "heart", so she is strongly associated with the color red and hearts.

Haato is a Japanese exchange student who studied in Australia. She returned to Japan in late 2020.[11]

Personality
Haato is weak to horror and jumpscares and will cry easily if she makes a mistake. She started out as a Tsundere but has since become more sociable. Despite the air of superiority she displays (sometimes even teasing/light bullying her fans), she will not hesitate to play the fool to entertain the audience. When she gets all emotional and serious, she really, really opens up to her audience about her feelings and problems.

Haato often does things on a whim and is self-centered. She‚Äôs a contrarian that tends to find things bothersome in addition to being very hasty and easily bored. She plays around with this personality with her viewers, but her true nature is that she is very loving with her viewers.

Her actions and choice of words stand out for being childish, but what also stands out is how she sometimes really behaves like a grownup and shows her philosophical thinking.
