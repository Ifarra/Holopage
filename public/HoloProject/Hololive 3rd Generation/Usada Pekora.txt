Official Bio
"Hiya-peko! Hiya-peko! Hiya-pekooo! I'm Usada Pekora, peko!"

A lonely rabbit-eared girl who loves carrots. She loves them so much that she always brings a few anywhere she goes.

Overview
A young and hip rabbit from Pekoland that appends "peko" at the end of her sentences. Part of the 3rd generation, Hololive Fantasy, she is eternally 111 years old (increments by 0.0000….1 every year). The conversion from Pekoland years to human years frequently changes depending on her mood. In the beginning, Pekora mentioned that when converted, it roughly equals late teens and early twenties; however, during her loli stream, she established that she was 3 years old (1 + 1 + 1 = 3 years old), and has continued to use that conversion method since.[13] Known for her chaotic personality and motormouth pace, she's quickly become one of the most well-known members of Hololive.

The carrots she has in her hair are raised in her family's farm. She wears them both as a fashion and snack. Although it is difficult to see, under the white dress is a bunny girl outfit. Not only is showing full body rare, she rarely shows full upper body, so seeing anything else is rare during the stream. Her scarf is a living being called Don-chan, which is always with her.

When she's upset, her right ear folds. When she plays horror games, it's permanently folded. Her ears are not detachable. According to Pekora, the reason why she has 4 ears (2 human, 2 rabbit) is because "humans like something resembling them, so to help me blend in, mom gave them to me." However, she gave one pair of her rabbit ears to Kiryu Coco on her birthday, claiming it'll grow back quickly. Additionally, her tail is hidden in the idol costume because she put it inside her spats.

Her representative emote is a pair of dancers in bunny suits (female).

Personality
Pekora is known for being very chaotic and a prankster, someone who likes to play by her own rules. She has a unique verbal tic in which she ends her sentences with the "-peko" suffix. Her peculiar laughter has been coined by some of her fans as the "arrow laugh".

She is quick to react angrily when things don't go her way. She tends to run away when she faces a powerful foe in video games, then apologizes meekly until she finds an opening or when the situation changes favorably, after which she quickly starts talking down to them again.

She is shy in real life or when there is a large group of people, but on her own stream she likes to talk a lot even without breaks. Despite all of that she is very caring to her friends and fans.
