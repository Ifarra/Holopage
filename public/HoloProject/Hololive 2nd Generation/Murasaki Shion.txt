Official Bio
"Hellshio! Murasaki Shion here!"

A child that randomly appears around the Underworld Academy... though she's actually an adult (or so she says). A self-proclaimed talented dark magician of noble birth (or so she says).

She almost never actually says "Hellshio."

Overview
Murasaki Shion born December 8, is a female black magician belonging to Hololive 2nd Generation. She debuted in August 17.[13], debuted her 3D model in May 12[14], and in August 01st got her 2nd costume.[15] She received her swimsuit in August 26[16] and finally got her New Years costume in January 02nd[17]

Shion is well-known for her smug attitude and love for puns. She is commonly seen as an annoying little brat ("kusogaki") because of her behavior and attitude especially towards fellow gen mate Minato Aqua who she also has a friendly rivalry with. The two occasionally hold collaborate streams, most commonly in the game Minecraft, which often end up in pranks and light-hearted sabotage. The two of them along with Nakiri Ayame form the "Manji-Gumi Group".

Shion has a preference for Nintendo Games and is seen to play them quite often. She unquestionably can't handle horror but enjoys playing other games casually. She can't take being mocked but she also loves doing so to anyone she feels like and will try her best to squeeze in any jokes or puns that usually fall flat.

Her representative emote is a crescent moon.
