Official Bio
"A-quality day to one and all! I'm Minato Aqua!"

A marine maid-styled virtual maid. She is trying her very best, yet is still sometimes awkward and clumsy.

Overview
Minato Aqua (湊あくあ) is a marine maid Virtual YouTuber for Hololive 2nd Generation unit. Her YouTube channel was created on July 31st and her twitter account was created few days later. On August 08th 2018 she posted her video debut to YouTube[11]. On April 8th 2019 she debuted her first 3D model[12] and debuted her 3D swimsuit model[13] a few months later in August 17th 2019. She also got a New Year Live2D costume in January 2nd 2020[14].

Aqua is most known to be a cute airhead maid who likes to prank her friends, but somehow it almost always backfires due to the combinations of her less than desirable luck and lack of preparations. Because of that, she tends to be the target of jokes and pranks from other members.

She loves to play competitive PVP games like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, League of Legends, and Apex Legends (where she managed to finish Season 4 at Diamond 4[15]). She also likes to complete challenge runs of games, some examples being beating Dark Souls in under 3 hours[16], a Sekiro speedrun in under 2 hours[17], or endurance Apex Legend stream until Diamond[18][19].

According to Aqua she joined Hololive as she was very introverted and wanted to be more social with other people. She auditioned for Hololive without knowing really what it was, only realizing at the audition that it is the agency with Tokino Sora and Shirakami Fubuki in it, that she knew of already.[20]

She admits she is a hikkikomori, but doesn't mind it and only wishes she could be better at socializing.

Her representative emote is an anchor due to her marine theme and anchors on her dress.
