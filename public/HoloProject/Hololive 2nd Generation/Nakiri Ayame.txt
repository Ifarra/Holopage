Official Bio
"Greetings, Humans! Yoohoo!"

A kimono-clad Oni girl from the Underworld Academy. As she loves to prank people, she always uses will-o’-the-wisp on them just to have fun. Many may not realize it, but she is actually the president of the student council.

Overview
Nakiri Ayame (Japanese: 百鬼あやめ) born December 13, is an oni and a member of Hololive 2nd Generation. Although her Twitter account and her Youtube Channel were both created on August 1, 2018, and August 11, 2018, respectively, she debuted on September 3, 2018. Her 3D model debut was on May 17, 2019 [14] and soon after, on August 9, 2019, she debuted her 3D Swimsuit model. [15] Her second outfit was announced on Twitter[16] and was revealed on Youtube in a livestream on November 23, 2019.[17]

She streams a variety of games on her channel, like Minecraft[18] — where she is possibly the best builder in Hololive — or FPS games such as PUBG[19] or Apex Legends. (where she ended Season 4 at Diamond 4) [20] Other games include Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Monster Hunter World (and its expansion, Iceborne), Mario Kart, ARK (though only for a few streams), Rhythm Heaven, Splatoon[21] and League of Legends[22].

She's known for her soothing voice and infectious giggles and laughs during her stream. She's also notoriously bad at waking up, as she's always the last to wake up in multiple morning wake-up streams. She also sings a lot on her streams. [23] [24] [25]

Her great luck is unmatched in all of Hololive when it comes to videogames and odds. Examples of her 'great luck' include, but are not limited to:

Her "The Stream Doesn't End Until I Fish Up an Enchanted Book!" Minecraft stream[26], where after she casts her first line, she gets an enchanted book. The odds of this happening is 0.7%.
Another Minecraft stream, titled "I Ain't Gonna Stop Until I Get My Diamonds!"[27], where 30 minutes after the stream started she finds a vein of 5 diamonds. Not wanting to end right there, she wanted to find a second vein, and 15 minutes after the first vein encounter, she finds a vein of 8 diamonds.
More recently, during an Apex stream[28], she mentions of a skin she wanted from a weapon, and after opening just one lootbox, she gets the aforementioned skin.
Her representative emote is a smiling "oni" face, since she is an oni.
