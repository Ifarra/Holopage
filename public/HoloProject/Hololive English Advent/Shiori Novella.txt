Official Bio
Driven by her thirst for knowledge, Shiori Novella is "The Archiver."

She turns her favorite stories and treasured memories into bookmarks and saves them.

By misfortune, she was found to have obtained forbidden knowledge within one of her stories and was imprisoned. But to her, that experience itself is but a fascinating story. In order to continue her search for more stories, she planned and executed a prison break.
