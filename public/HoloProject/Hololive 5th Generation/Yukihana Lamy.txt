Official Bio
"Lamyoohoo!"

hololive 5th Generation's blue rep, Yukihama Lamy!
The daughter of a noble family from a distant, snowy land. She decided to leave her home, along with her companion Daifuku, after hololive's streams full of fun and color touched her heart. Her serious personality belies her naive, sheltered nature.

Overview
Yukihina Lamy is a snow elf virtual youtuber who is a part of Hololive 5th gen. 
Her YouTube account was created on April 12th and debuted on August 8th. She is most known for her soft-spoken voice and gentle nature on streams. 
Lamy enjoys playing various video games such as Minecraft and ARK but is adverse to playing horror games which she has played on occasion with fellow gen mate Shishiro Botan,
who enjoyed ceaselessly teasing her and found amusement in her petrified reactions[11][12]. Talking and drinking streams are another favorite of Lamy's and her drinking habits have earned her the reputation of being the drunkard of gen 5.[13][14]

Personality
Yukihana Lamy is a kind-hearted soft spoken individual who shows great empathy when interacting with her fellow mates and fans alike. 
While she may seem timid and shy at first, it quickly becomes evident that Lamy can be as bold as they come and is not afraid to assert herself when the situation calls for it.
She does however get easily flustered when fans or even other hololive members such as Matsuri begin to flirt with her. Lamy is often referred to as "Mama" by her viewers and other hololive members due to her caring and motherly nature. She is very close to her fellow gen mates and often collaborates with them, more so with Botan.
