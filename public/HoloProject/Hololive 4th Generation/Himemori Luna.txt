Official Bio

Her moon-shaped accessories are said to be the crest of a country in another world.

Overview
Himemori Luna (姫森ルーナ), born October 10th, is a member of Hololive 4th Generation. Described as a 0 year old princess of sweets, Luna acts in a childlike manner and is dressed appropriately cutely in all pink. Debuting on January 4th, 2020[11], Luna is the final member of Hololive 4th Generation. Her twitter was created 3 days earlier at January 1st, 2020.

Luna's fan group is referred to as "Luknights" (ルーナイト), a portmanteau of Luna and Knights, giving the fans an image of a group of knights that answers to the Princess of sweets herself.

As a "0 year old princess", her speech is relatively childish, often employing simple words and sentences (fully intentionally). She usually adds the words "nanora" (なのら) to the end of her sentences, including on tweets, as a verbal tic. Luna also has a sort of catchphrase that is used to start streams and sometimes just randomly on other occasions, namely "Nnaaaaaa"(んなあああああ), with the length of "a" always changing. This "catchphrase" is so characteristic of Luna that it is the go-to for any member that tries to imitate her, as imitating her voice is apparently difficult (being a the voice of a 0 year old princess)

Luna is quite the avid gamer, and her channel is filled with a variety of games, mostly retro games and RPGs, the two types of games that Luna favors the most, though she's not as big a retro lover as Inugami Korone in comparison. Not only retro and RPGs, Luna also plays a variety of other games (including both the currently trending Vtuber games, and other games outside the aforementioned genres). Generally speaking, Luna has a very good game sense, displayed in her ability to quickly pick up on a game's mechanic. Most famously perhaps is her Dark Souls playthrough, in which she displayed considerable amount of skills, enough to be considered one of the best players in the Vtuber community.

Luna also has an occasional electone (エレクトーン, marketed as a single person orchestra, they are a brand of electronic organs manufactured by the Yamaha corporation[12][13]) practicing stream. These electone practice sessions usually happen when Luna is in the mood to practice or before a large event (such as her birthday[14]), and consists of Luna trying out and playing many different songs on her electone, which have grown to be quite popular as one of her unique niches. She has a particular fondness for Studio Ghibli songs, of which one of her personal favorites is "A Town With An Ocean View" from Kiki's Delivery Service.

Her representative emote is a piece of candy, since she is a princess from a candy kingdom.

Personality
Befitting of her status as the princess, Luna acts in a manner sickeningly cute akin to candy so terribly sweet. As much as everyone agree that Himemori Luna is really cute, everyone also occasionally gets pissed at her, a prime example being Houshou Marine and Inuyama Tamaki, where the two express their annoyance very verbally to Luna in their collab stream[15][16]

Despite the presentation and theme of cuteness that is associated with Luna, her actual personality behind the cuteness is revealed to be quite mischievous borderline sadistic, competitive and quite composed. Luna's interaction with the other members is often composed of teasing, as she use her cute acts to try to get under their skin and sometime simply being directly mischievous to them, both to her seniors and fellow 4th Generation member. On the flipside, Luna can also get quite attached to others, most evident in her interaction with Natsuiro Matsuri. Luna often acts spoiled towards Matsuri and Matsuri, in return, spoils Luna, albeit it appears that the way Matsuri treats Luna is not nearly the way she hoped it would be. Luna and Matsuri named their pair FestivalLuna (フェステイバルーナ). Outside of her interaction with the other members, she can also at times gets quite mischievous towards her listeners, such as when she keep playing cricket background noises on her midnight piano streams, or when she streamed a Muse Dash playthrough[17] consisting mostly of the song Punai Punai Taiso (プナイプナイたいそう), treating the song as an addiction or poison to be spread.

Compared to some of the other girls, Luna can be considered as one of the more composed, albeit instead of panicking Luna's go-to reaction is replaced by an audible and almost childlike frustration. This is very visible when she gets competitive in games such as Apex Legends, or when she plays horror game. Her frustration comes out in the form of her motor mouth, where she starts rapidly talking about all sorts of things, usually in relation to what is going on (such as somewhat rationalizing whatever happens in the horror game). Not only in video games and frustration, her rapid-fire talking can even appear when having a regular conversation with others, usually when asked a question, where she will sometimes rapidly go into details regarding her answer.
