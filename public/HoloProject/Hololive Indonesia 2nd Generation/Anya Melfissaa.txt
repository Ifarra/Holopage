Official Bio
"Good day! This is Anya Melfissa from hololive ID 2nd Generation."

An ancient weapon known as “Keris,” she was granted human form through a mystical ritual performed by her master. She’s just about always sleeping or playing games. Living mostly alone for so long has made her tend to be apathetic towards things and people she’s uninterested in, but when talking about things she likes, she can be quite childlike and passionate. Her base personality is actually apathetic, especially towards humans. Don’t let looks fool you - that’s what every foolish human always does to themselves somehow.

Overview
Anya Melfissa is an Indonesian Kris dagger, she is the second member of Holoro she debuted in December 5, 2020. She enjoys streaming horror games and usually stream those alongside games that involve shooting and/or surviving (like Rust, Raft and Half-Life 2). Most of her collabs are done with other ID or JP members, when collabing with EN members she is usually invited by the EN member, and when speaking with a EN member that can speak Japanese she will usually speak in Japanese (since her Japanese is better than her English).

Personality
Anya is an introverted, sleepy, calm yandere dagger, a contrast when comparing to the other members of Hololive Indonesia 2nd Generation. She tends to mumble more and talk less than the other members due to being nervous while streaming, this however doesn't stop her of being a smug sadistic[10][11] loli. Her fans often say that during horror game streams, the scariest part of the stream is Anya herself.[12] She is also notably hard to scare.[13][14] Even though she is usually described as funny and easy going when interacting with her senpais and kouhais[15], she can have a very demeaning sense of humor[16][17], a humor that is unexpected considering that she first shown herself as being very insecure. She is also a massive Otaku that love Gacha games (specially FGO), Vocaloid, Anime and Visual novels.
