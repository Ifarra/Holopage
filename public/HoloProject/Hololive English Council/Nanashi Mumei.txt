Official Bio
Guardian of "Civilization"

A member of the Council and the Guardian of "Civilization," a concept crafted by mankind.

As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts‚Äîthe mark that humans have left on the world‚Äîshe is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.

She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.

For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels. That is what gave her the idea of making her own friend out of a material that was indispensable to the development of human civilization: paper.

"It may fade and rip, but once a friend, forever a friend."

Overview
Nanashi Mumei (‰∏ÉË©©„É†„É°„Ç§), born on August 4th, is an owl VTuber who debuted as part of hololive English -Council- representing ‚ÄúCivilization‚Äù. As an all-seeing guardian of mankind, she protects all who she looks upon and hopes everyone can be their best version of themselves.[12]

Mumei‚Äôs streams are characterised by the duality between a relatively low energy, relaxing, and comfortable tone (which she takes pride in[13][14]) to another side which is more spontaneous and energetic; with her often demonstrating psychopathic tendencies in these moments. Though the disparity between her macabre thoughts and cute voice surprised many at first, the line separating these two sides has since blurred to a point of seamlessness ‚Äì with Mumei‚Äôs appreciation of the grotesque and ‚Äòcursed‚Äô being wholly embraced by Hoomans today. Possessing a dorky sense of humour, she is also a fan of puns and frequently uses owl or bird-related wordplay in her Tweets and streams (as evidenced by her choice of fan name and Twitter hashtags).

As an owl, Mumei is stereotypically forgetful and birdbrained with her forgetting both her age and previous names over the millennia. This led her to refer to her mascot only as ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù and her pet animal as "Animal" because she wouldn‚Äôt be able to forgive herself were she to forget their names.[15][16] Despite this forgetfulness, Mumei‚Äôs love of knowledge, drawing and singing come across strongly from her streams: with her frequently searching online during streams for information she either forgot or is unsure of;[17][18][19][20] her frequent drawing-themed streams and knowledge of techniques demonstrated by painter Bob Ross;[21][22][23] and her regularly singing parts of songs from artists across a wide range of genres ‚Äì from Kelly Clarkson[24] and My Chemical Romance,[25] to The Story So Far[26][27] and Backstreet Boys,[28] to various songs from Disney movies[29][30][31] and those from the musical adaptation of Les Mis√©rables[32][33] (which is also her favourite musical[34][35]).

In terms of larger-scale forays into singing Mumei released an original song titled A New Start on 17th January, 2022,[36] with this song first previewed during her debut stream.[37] She has since covered numerous songs, the first of which being Silhouette by Kana-Boon (an OP for the anime Naruto: Shippuden)[38] and has also held a multitude of archived and unarchived karaoke streams covering both English and Japanese songs (see General Trivia).

Her representative fan emoji is a feather because her physical form is of an owl.

Personality
As a cheerful, caring and introverted[13] barn owl,[39][40] Nanashi Mumei takes her job seriously as a guardian protector of mankind. Though she has elements that make Hoomans want to protect her ‚Äî such as the ease with which she becomes embarrassed and overwhelmed, as well as her general forgetfulness (the latter frequent enough to make Hoomans joke that she ‚Äúforgor‚Äù and ‚Äúrembers‚Äù during streams) ‚Äî she undeniably takes pride of place as the apex predator of the skies with her boundless, near-psychopathic fascination of the morbid and cursed; a trait most prominently evidenced in her drawing streams.

In stark contrast to her psychopathic tendencies, an early instance of Mumei being overwhelmed in a heartwarming manner was her monetisation celebration stream, in which she chose not to read chat at the beginning because she knew that she would (and eventually did) get startled by the fast rate of donations sent to her.[41] However, this same stream also highlighted the care and appreciation she holds for her fans, with her stating numerous times throughout the stream that she sees the precious time people set aside to watch her streams ‚Äúgenuinely as valuable [as money]‚Äù.[42][43][44] Similar sentiments were also shared during Mumei's membership opening stream in which she said that she didn't mind if Hoomans didn't become members as she was "so appreciative of... anybody who comes and watches",[45] and also was understanding of viewers who wanted to wait until she was feeling better before purchasing membership because she was feeling notably unwell at the time of this stream - this choice making "a lot of sense" to her.[46]

Outside of these celebration streams, her appreciation can further be seen in frequent Tweets expressing her gratefulness to those who watch and convey their enjoyment of her streams (particularly when the stream does not go as planned),[47][48][49] her responses to those expressing gratitude for her content during streams,[50][51][52][53][54] and her general interactions with chat. Such interactions include her pleading with tired fans staying up late for her stream to go get some sleep,[55][56][57] as well as her expressing the happiness she felt knowing Hoomans were inspired to draw because of her, and were also using her #watchMEI Twitter hashtag to draw alongside her during her first drawing stream.[58]

Although she has moments of high energy and excitability (especially while under the effects of caffeine), Mumei regards herself as a ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù individual with the social aspect of streaming being surprisingly tiring at times. She believes herself to be an awkward individual[59] and this introverted disposition manifests itself during streams whenever she finds it difficult to know what to say; with her often resorting to impromptu singing or noises to fill the silence if streaming in silence,[32][60][61][62] or at times struggling to find an appropriate greeting or response while in the presence of others[63][64] (though this can result in entertaining but nonsensical conversations with other hololive members such as Gawr Gura[65][66] and Mori Calliope[67]). These bouts of random sounds and responses may also be partially attributed to her birdbrained nature, with Mumei herself admitting that she has a very short attention span and finds it difficult to multitask.[68][69]
